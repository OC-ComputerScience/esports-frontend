<summary><h2>Making Changes</h1></summary>
Before making any changes to the code, make your own "feature branch" that you will stage all of your changes on. This may have been fairly obvious, but I thought I    would put this here to provide clarity if it is necessary (I know collectively, we don't have that much experience with github).
